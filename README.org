* Synopsis

Walk-through and implementation of the miniAdapton paper.

* Description

Adapton is a framework for /incremental computation/: this is for times when you need to re-run a calculation with slightly different inputs whilst minimizing the amount of re-computation. Memoization + ability to handle mutation.

micro- and miniAdapton form a core and an augmented but still small implementation of the Adapton framework, respectively. Very much in the same vein as [[https://git.sr.ht/~ashton314/microKanren][microKanren]].
